# Projects
NEW ADDITION: 
- Shapes and Sizes. Made with Unity.

Created initially as a project with a friend until a small prototype was developed.

I spent one week from June 9th-16th 2024 to improve and expand the game to it's current state with 3 levels, UI and fun gameplay. 

The idea of the game is that the player, a blue polygon and enemies (red polygons) health values are represented by the number 
of edges that their shape has (square and triangle have 4 and 3 health).

Genre: Bullet Hell

Controls: 
 - Windows: Player moves with the mouse position while holding down the left mouse button.
 - Android: Player moves touch.

Android APK and Windows Executable from June 16th currently available.
 
 
 
- RockPaperScissorAI. Made with Unity.

Created as a weekend long Game Jam school assignment. 

The goal was to create a simulation of an arena with 3 groups (rocks, papers and scissors) that are use the same base group 
and individual behaviour scripts with basic Seek and Flee that with the group speed modified with Fuzzy Logic.

The application does not have user input and can be adjusted with the UI for altering specific variables.
