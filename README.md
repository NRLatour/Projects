# Projects
NEW ADDITION: Shapes and Sizes.
Created initially as a project with a friend until a small prototype was developed.
I spent one week from June 9th-16th 2024 to improve and expand the game to it's current state with 3 levels, UI and fun gameplay. 
The idea of the game is that the player, a blue polygon and enemies (red polygons) health values are represented by the number 
of edges that their shape has (square and triangle have 4 and 3 health).
Genre: Bullet Hell
Controls: 
 - Windows: Player moves with mouse while clicking.
 - Android: Player moves touch.
Android APK and Windows Executable from June 16th currently available.
